# VSCode Profiles

Taken from Andy Van Slaars GitHub [repo] you can use profiles in
VSCode.

He uses an alias in ZSH but I use Fish so will be doing so for that.

I will set up a folder for [OBS Studio]

As I'm a bash on Windows user my config is slightly different:

```bash
code --extensions-dir 'D:\repos\vs-code-profiles\obs\exts' --user-data-dir 'D:\repos\vs-code-profiles\obs\data'
```

Because I have VSCode installed on my Windows partition I need to
Windows file locations in place of bash.
